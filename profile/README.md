Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with extensive experience in building high-quality web applications and services. I specialize in full-stack development, with a strong emphasis on JavaScript and Python. My journey in tech has equipped me with proficiency in frameworks like React, Node.js, and Django, allowing me to create dynamic and interactive user experiences while ensuring robust backend functionalities.

Over the years, I have collaborated on numerous projects, from developing responsive landing pages to architecting complex microservices. I adhere to best practices in software development, including clean code, agile methodologies, and continuous integration/deployment pipelines, ensuring that my projects are not only effective but also scalable and maintainable.

My current tech stack includes:
- Frontend: React, Angular, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Django, Flask
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Other Technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, RESTful APIs, GraphQL

I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skill set. Currently, I’m exploring TypeScript and Cloud Computing services such as AWS and Azure.

In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects and enjoy sharing my knowledge through tech blogs and tutorials. You can check out some of my pinned repositories showcasing my recent work, including:
